# Define clamav services for each Rails environment
#
# service can be
#  default (use the default Hyrax clamav process version)
#  daemon (use a daemon, needs port and host)
#  none (don't do any scanning regardless of what's loaded)

## DEFAULT
# If you specify the "default" scanner
#  * Must have `gem "clamav"` in your Gemfile
#  * Will use the default Hyrax scanner
#
#  If the `clamav` gem can't be found
#  it'll log a warning and just not scan anything

### DAEMON
# If you specify 'daemon'
#   * You need `gem "clamav-client"` in your Gemfile
#   * You must set the port and host for the daemon
# You'll throw errors in these conditions:
#  * The port and host aren't set
#  * The 'clamav-client' gem isn't installed
#  * The daemon specified can't be contacted

### NONE
# Will log a warning and not do any virus scanning,
# regardless of the other settings

# Example
# testing:
#   service: none
# development:
#   service: default
# production:
#   service: none
#   port: 3310
#   host: 127.0.0.1


testing:
  service: none
development:
  service: none
  port: 3310
  host: 127.0.0.1
production:
  service: none
